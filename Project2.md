# Light Graphics

**Stage 1:**  Proposal

A proposal for a project requires at least three students,
with at least one student from each block!  (This will require
you to utilize GitHub and learn about branches, commits, and pulls.)
The proposal must address each of the following:

- [ ] General description of the goal or purpose.  What are you trying to make happen or solve?  Feel free to design projects which utilize content from other courses (simulations, for example), address and analyze real daata and problems (the environment, anyone?), or have other useful impacts.
- [ ] Anticipated file structure (i.e. what classes will you write, where will the `main` method exist?  Show me that you have thought enough about this problem or project to begin to recognize some of the complexity you will need to account for.
- [ ] New Java - your proposal/project must require you to utilize some new code structures.  This could include learning how to read/write files into a JAVA program, rudimentary graphics, or some utilize some other `class` for your project.
- [ ] Division of labor:  who will do what in this project?  Is there enough required to justify the time and number of people?  This will be the sole task which you will be engaged in during class time, but there is minimal expectation for work outside of class (unless you are not meeting your goals).
