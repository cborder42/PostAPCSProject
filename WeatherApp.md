**Stage 1:**  Proposal

A proposal for a project requires at least three students,
with at least one student from each block!  (This will require
you to utilize GitHub and learn about branches, commits, and pulls.)
The proposal must address each of the following:


- The goal of this program is to return certain weather conditions(temperature, wind speeds, humitity, etc..) of a city that the user inputs. This will be done by calling the open weather API. The weather API updates in real time. There will be a graphic which looks like a simple weather app, that says "weather app" and an "input city" box for the user. 
- Our classes will call the API and will contain acessor methods to call the values in the data set. The main method will be in the same file outside of the classes. The data from the API will be put into variables as the city is called, and methods will exist to access them and print them out. 
- The new java that our group is going to learn is the implementation of the API, and the proper use of that data in it. We will also learn how to create graphics/drawing and put a text box in it.
