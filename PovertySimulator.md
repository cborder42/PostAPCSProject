# Poverty Simulator
## Purpose/Goal: 
This is a game which has two goals: 
- To raise awareness for people in poverty
- For the user to have a fun experience in a simulation type game. 
The user is to start with 1000 dollars in their bank account and have to survive through the month with multiple risk/reward type choices they have to make throughout the game. The goal is to be able to pay the rent at the end of the month. 
## Anticipated File Structure
**Character class:** Will contain the Main Method and will determine the starting amount of money and will set gas prices and rent price based on the user’s input (how far they want to be away at work in miles). It will also have the day that you are on.  
**Events class:** Will have multiple different events which have individual fines. Everyday this class will be called and will decrease the amount of money from the total amount of money they have.
**Job class:** There is a number of strikes and a pay day amount. If you get three strikes your pay day amount decreases to 0, but if you don’t have three strikes then your pay stays the same. It is paid to you every week. 
## New Java
Introduce graphics into the game, mainly different ways of displaying the text and also introducing “buttons” for potential choices in the program. 
## Division of Labor
One person would do the graphics part, another person would write the Events class, while another person would write the character and the job class.  (total of three people)
