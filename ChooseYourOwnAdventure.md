# Choose Your Own Adventure

## Proposed by Ethan Hu, Sonja Larson, Catherine Liu


- [ ] General description of the goal or purpose. What are you trying to make happen or solve? Feel free to design projects which utilize content from other courses (simulations, for example), address and analyze real daata and problems (the environment, anyone?), or have other useful impacts.

Story based game where a user will go through a game. Each part of the story will have a graphic and some number of choices to move onto the next part. The story will have a number of different endings for people to play through.



- [ ] Anticipated file structure (i.e. what classes will you write, where will the `main` method exist? Show me that you have thought enough about this problem or project to begin to recognize some of the complexity you will need to account for.

Using multiple classes and methods we can combine the different parts of the game to create possible storylines to work through with different endings and possible achievements.

There would be a main file to play through the game which would call parts of other classes which can be written with different branches of the story.


- [ ] New Java - your proposal/project must require you to utilize some new code structures. This could include learning how to read/write files into a JAVA program, rudimentary graphics, or some utilize some other `class` for your project.


The program would be using a graphic or some other form of graphic/imported photo file (depending on interest) for each branch of the story as the screen would display the graphic/image as well as a text part of the story before taking user input to determine the next choice. Timer loops


- [ ] Division of labor: who will do what in this project? Is there enough required to justify the time and number of people? This will be the sole task which you will be engaged in during class time, but there is minimal expectation for work outside of class (unless you are not meeting your goals).

Length and content of the story can be changed and different storylines can merge/split.
