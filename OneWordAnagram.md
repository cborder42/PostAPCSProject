# One Word Anagram

**Description:**

One Word Anagram is a game where you must guess any existing word using all the letters given to you. If you guess the word correctly, you will progress to the next level and your score will increase. You will have a total of 5 minutes to complete as many levels you can. In each level, the number of letters in each word is increased with an additional letter is added for every level progressed.

**File structure:**

We will use Java for the backend and HTML and CSS for the front end. We will pull from a word bank API.

Classes we will write:

1. GameClass (contains Main method)
2. WordClass, UserClass

1 person will work on each class (WordClass, GameClass, UserClass and the Frontend).

- [ ] General description of the goal or purpose.  What are you trying to make happen or solve?  Feel free to design projects which utilize content from other courses (simulations, for example), address and analyze real daata and problems (the environment, anyone?), or have other useful impacts.
- [ ] Anticipated file structure (i.e. what classes will you write, where will the `main` method exist?  Show me that you have thought enough about this problem or project to begin to recognize some of the complexity you will need to account for.
- [ ] New Java - your proposal/project must require you to utilize some new code structures.  This could include learning how to read/write files into a JAVA program, rudimentary graphics, or some utilize some other `class` for your project.
- [ ] Division of labor:  who will do what in this project?  Is there enough required to justify the time and number of people?  This will be the sole task which you will be engaged in during class time, but there is minimal expectation for work outside of class (unless you are not meeting your goals).
