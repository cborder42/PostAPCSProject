Solar System Planetary Graphics 

Stage 1: Proposal

Light Graphics
test Stage 1: Proposal

The project will focus on creating a simple, visual simulation of the rotation of randomly generated planet objects orbiting a fixated sun object. 
The program user can choose between randomized or customized numbers of planets, sun size, and planet sizes. Planets will have their own defined circular orbits, 
centered around the sun and moving along the path at varying speeds and directions (these will always be randomized). Each planet will have a minimum distance
between orbits and from the sun. 

There will be planet subclass in our solar system class, creating our planets. The main method will take in the user choice and customizations to generate
our solar system. There will be methods for the movement of the planets and the graphics, and for spacing and sizing of planets. This project will be based
on rudimentary graphics. 

The division of work will be someone working on the solar system class (creating sun objects, the main methods, etc.) and will help with work on the planet 
subclass (because it will probably be a lot more work). The other people will focus on the planet subclass and graphics (random placement, planet visuals).
